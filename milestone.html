      <ul>
        <li>We have managed to inject and implement shaders in Genshin Impact</li>
        <li>We have contacted the NeRF studio team and have gotten access to their source code.</li>
        <li>We have integrated images and mp4 videos and have managed to feed these photos/videos into NeRF studio.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Preliminary Results</h1>
      <p>We have implemented an oil pastel filter on top of the game's files.</p>
      <p>Here are some screenshots of the effects of the filter.</p>

      <p>Here is a video of the shader that is injected into the game.</p>

      <h1>Reflecting on Progress</h1>
      <p>I believe that overall, we are slightly behind on our original progress, since we originally thought that
        the LeRF source code for NeRF studio would be already made public. Since it was not made public at the time of
        the milestone, we had to contact the LeRF team and wait for them to respond to us. That took a few days for them
        to publish the source code, so we were delayed for a few days on the LeRF end of this project. We believe that we
        are on track to finish the shaders on time, since we already have a type of shader implemented and injected into
        the game. We have also figured out how to obtain the necessary features from the game scene for NeRF studio. Overall,
        we belive that we are still on track for the deadline but are slightly delayed from our original ambitious plan because
        we were focusing on other class assignments and the second midterm.
      </p>
